# Dotfiles [![Build Status](https://github.com/fklein/dotfiles/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fklein/dotfiles/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

These are my everly evolving personal dotfiles.

This uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation.
After cloning the repo, just run `install` to automatically set up the
environment. The installation is idempotent and can safely be run multiple
times.
